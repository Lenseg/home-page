As a central component of the UNDP’s SIDS Offer, the visualization and analytics features of this platform will help SIDS to respond to the SAMOA Pathway and the 2030 agenda by rising up to the urgent challenges of climate change and their green and blue transition. By focusing on the needs of SIDS, this tool has been designed specifically to feature datasets about Digital Transformation, Blue Economy, and Climate Action.  There are three main types of data within the SIDS data platform, including data on the UNDP portfolio of projects and investment in SIDS, country-level development indicators, and geospatial data. For each data type we have developed interfaces within the platform to visualize, analyze, and export these data.\n              </p>\n            </v-expansion-panel-content>\n          </v-expansion-panel>\n          <v-divider/>\n          <v-expansion-panel>\n            <v-expansion-panel-header>What are the sources of data used?</v-expansion-panel-header>\n            <v-expansion-panel-content>\n              <p>\n                The SIDS data platform uses all publicly available datasets from a broad base of partner agencies and research publications. This includes data from the World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, UNDESA, IRENA, ITU, IGRAC, IHME, FAO, UNCTAD, UNDESA, Yale, CIESIN, OECD, UNWTO, ILO, and many additional sources. All citations are provided with the corresponding dataset within the platform.

In our next phase, we intend to use these collated datasets to build analysis tools that identify trends and generate insights specifically focused on the developmental challenges and solutions relevant for SIDS.\n              </p>\n            </v-expansion-panel-content>\n          </v-expansion-panel>\n          <v-divider/>\n          <v-expansion-panel>\n            <v-expansion-panel-header>Who should I contact to learn more?</v-expansion-panel-header>\n            <v-expansion-panel-content>\n              <p>\n                To learn more about UNDP’s SIDS Offer, please visit our\n                <a href=\"https://www.sparkblue.org/dashboard/small-island-developing-states\" target=\"_blank\">\n                  SparkBlue page</a>.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                For questions about UNDP’s SIDS Offer, “Rising up for SIDS”, please contact:<br/>\n                <i>Riad Meddeb, riad.meddeb@undp.org</i> – <i>Senior Principal Advisor for SIDS</i><br/>\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                For technical questions about the platform please contact<br/>\n                <i>Benjamin Keller, benjamin.keller@undp.org</i><br/>\n              </p>\n            </v-expansion-panel-content>\n          </v-expansion-panel>\n        </v-expansion-panels>\n        <v-card flat>\n          <v-card-text>\n            <div class=\"d-flex align-center justify-space-between\">\n              <p  class=\"mr-auto mb-0\">\n                Follow our biweekly SIDS Bulletin\n              </p>\n              <v-btn\n                class=\"mr-0 ml-2\"\n                color=\"primary\"\n                rounded\n                depressed\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                href=\"https://undp.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=cf50bc7216b0c4b063618fbac&id=c2c8d779ea\"\n                small\n              >Subscribe</v-btn>\n            </div>\n          </v-card-text>\n        </v-card>\n      </v-col>\n\n      <v-col class=\"d-none d-md-block\" md=\"3\">\n        <template v-for=\"(resource, index) in resources\">\n          <resource :key=\"index\" :resource=\"resource\" />\n        </template>\n      </v-col>\n    </v-row>\n  </v-container>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport Resource from './children/Resource';\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'Portfolio',\n  data() {\n    return {\n      resources: [{\n        \"name\": \"Rising Up for SIDS Offer\",\n        \"description\": \"UNDP’s integrated SIDS offer articulates a clear strategy to respond to their most pressing needs as well as bring forth innovative solutions to the complex developmental challenges they face for a better future for people and planet.\",\n        \"links\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \" Full version\",\n                \"link\": \"https://spark.adobe.com/page/KdCp73pb85itN/\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Two-pager\",\n                \"link\": \"https://spark.adobe.com/page/9myaX3gvA4gt5/\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"image\":\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SIDS-Dashboard/api/main/data/cms/images/undpSidsOffer.jpeg\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"UNDP SIDS Progress Report\",\n        \"description\": \"A detailed overview the UNDP Rising Up For SIDS Portfolio.\",\n        \"links\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Download\",\n                \"link\": \"https://express.adobe.com/page/3hg2U1XZZ6yh9/\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"image\":\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SIDS-Dashboard/api/main/data/cms/images/progressReport.jpeg\"\n\n    }]\n    }\n  },\n  components:{\n    Resource\n  },\n  computed: {\n  }\n}\n</script>\n<style>\n    .about-block_header{\n      font-size: 32px;\n      font-weight: 700;\n      color: #0969FA;\n    }\n    .text-field {\n      width: 100%\n    }\n    .about-block {\n      min-height: 100vh;\n    }\n   .about-block .v-expansion-panel::after {\n     border-top: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12) !important;\n   }\n</style>\n"]}]}
